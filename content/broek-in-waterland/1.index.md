If you’re searching for:

Authentic Dutch villages ✔️ Things to do near Amsterdam ✔️ A peaceful day trip that’s not Volendam or Zaanse Schans ✔️

**The most beautiful village in The Netherlands** ✔️

Then **Broek in Waterland is your answer.** And your reset button.

Just **15 minutes from Amsterdam**. But a whole world away.  No crowds. No plastic clogs. No waiting in line for a €10 pancake you’ll regret. Just still water, wooden housen, crooked chimneys, and the sound of your own breath slowing down.

**Welcome to Broek in Waterland** — the best-kept secret north of Amsterdam. Postcard-pretty. Quietly iconic. And yes — **it’s real.**

**1. Walk through a living postcard**  

Tiny canals. Authentic 17th-century pastel houses. Wooden bridges with flowers on both sides. Locals playing bocce ball on the town square. This is not Disneyland. This is real life.

**2. Rent a bike and ride the Waterland Route**  

Scenic, flat, no stress. Ride past cows, dykes, and sleepy villages that don’t care who you are. In the best way. Turn around and come back to Broek in Waterland.

**3. Have lunch with locals at Het Broeker Huis**  

Skip the pancake house. Walk past the church. Find the hidden gem. Part café, part town square, part love letter to the village. Order home baked bread and house-roasted coffee, soup or a simple, hearty dish from locally sourced ingredients cooked on a wooden fire. Sit by the window, and overhear three generations arguing about cake.

**4. Do absolutely nothing by the water**  

Sit. Think. Or don’t. Watch the ducks. Write a postcard. Visit the tiniest grocery-store you've ever seen. See where Napoleon was refused service. Fall in love with silence. And end the day where you started **– without wanting to leave.**

*And guess what - when our B\&B opens this summer, you won't have to (opens in new tab)*

Volendam is great — if you love tour buses, overpriced herring, and souvenir shops that smell like plastic.  But if you want to feel something real? Broek is for you.

Here, you won’t see performers in costume. You’ll see a kid jump off a bridge into the canal. A grandpa wave from his porch. A dog nap in the sun.

You won’t remember what the amazing lunch cost at **Het Broeker Huis** (a lot less than the fatty fries in Volendam, that's for sure). You’ll remember the crooked house that leaned like it was tired. The woman on her bike with four kids who said “hoi” like you lived here.  

The laughter from the canal-side patio of **Restaurant De Broeker Huiskamer,** that made you smile for no reason.

**Come to Het Broeker Huis** – the heart of Broek in Waterland

**From Amsterdam Central Station**:

Bus 312, 314 or 315 to Broek in Waterland (15 min). Smile and wave at the herds, that will sit for another 20 to take the mandatory selfie in Volendam. Better yet — rent a bike and enjoy one of the most beautiful rides in the Netherlands. No guide. No ticket. Just go. You can walk the entire village in 15 minutes — not that you would want to.

**Best days to visit:** weekdays from 10am to dinner. Evenings for sunset by the water.

**Bring:** good shoes. A curious mood. Appetite for good food and local treats

**Don’t** **bring:** a checklist. A rigid schedule. A rush. Expectations.

*Never want to leave again? We understand.*

Let Amsterdam wear the crown. broek in Waterland wears the wool sweater, offers you tea and tells better stories.

You came for a quick break from the city.  You found something slower, warmer, closer. Something you didn’t even know you were looking for.

And it starts at Het Broeker Huis. Your lunch stop. Dinner spot. Your village living room.  

Your reason to stay a little longer.
